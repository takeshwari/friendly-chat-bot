## Anti-bullying Chatbot

This is a friendly artificially intelligent chatbot. It is designed to assist children being bullied. It can be also integrated into social media app to prevent hateful comments. :octocat:


Currently, I am trying to implement the following functionality: 
  1. Detect negative statements against someone
    - chatbot will trigger a response 
  2. Detect negative sentiment towards oneself (i.e. self-harm)
    - chatbot will guide them to suicide helpline 
  3. Ask student about hobbies, interests
     - create a list of suggested activities to do
        - ex: list of books, games, movies
